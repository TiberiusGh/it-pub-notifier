# IT-Pub-Notifier

(Start coding by completing the readme file first)

## MVP

This is an application that helps me keep track of local IT-pubs and notify my about them. Local it pubs are aranged trough a known webbsite. The application will visit the website a few times per day and notify me about the events that are "It-Pub". The notification will include the date, time, the title (icluding the name of the company hosting the It-pub) and location.

I will use Disord to send the notifications.

## For future development:

- Create a .ics file for the event containing all the necessary data
- Notify multiple users
